This project implements a https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#httpServer[Micronaut HTTP server] backed onto the Servlet API and includes various subprojects that allow running popular Servlet containers as servers.

This project is for users who fall into one of the following categories:

* Users who want to use Micronaut but the target deployment environment is based on Servlets
* Users who prefer the thread per connection model of the Servlet API over the Event Loop model provided by the default Netty-based HTTP server
* Users who have existing Servlets and/or Filters that they wish to combine with Micronaut.
